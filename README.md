# Computer-Graphic
Projects I have done in course Computer Graphic (EECS 351) and Intermediate Computer Graphic (EECS 495).
Basically built with WebGL using javascript, and also some Ray Tracing and particle system things.
You can interact with any of the projects, you can always use H or F1 for instruction about how to play around with them, or read the documents for more detailed informations.
The little basic math lib and some of the material parameters are from Professor John Tumblin, and all the projects are done under his instruction.

351 Projects are building a more and more complex system step by step. So there are plently of connections between the projects.
351 Project A : Human-like Hand and Paper Plane

351 Project B: Human hand and camera control

495 Projects are more advanced and complex comparing to 351, covered two big topics, Particle System (Project A) and Ray Tracing (Project B).   

495 Project A: Particle System with more than 5000 independent particles

495 Project B: Ray-Tracing with multiple light source on various materilas with preview    
Due to the system operates 16 independent light source and 4*4 Jittered Super sample for antialiasing, the ray tracing process may take sevral minutes (based on different graph card, GTX960 takes about 5 minutes). So to save your time, I do suggest directly read the document, there are plenty of result images in there.
