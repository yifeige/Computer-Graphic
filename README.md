# Computer-Graphic
Projects I have done in course Computer Graphic (EECS 351) and Intermediate Computer Graphic (EECS 495).
Basically built with WebGL using javascript, and also some Ray Tracing and particle system things.
You can interact with any of the projects, you can always use H or F1 for instruction about how to play around with them, or read the documents for more detailed informations.
The little basic math lib and some of the material parameters are from Professor John Tumblin, and all the projects are done under his instruction.

351 Projects are building a more and more complex system step by step. So there are plently of connections between the projects.
